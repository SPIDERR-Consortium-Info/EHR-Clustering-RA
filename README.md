# EHR-Clustering-RA
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes swelling and pain in the joints. As others, we reckon that RA is an heterogeneous disease and that subset identification is an important first step to a better etiologic understanding. A tantalizing idea is that the factors that cause this latent clinical heterogeneity are already present in patients at baseline.

Therefore, we aim to refine the taxonomy of RA by "unlocking" the wealth of data available in the Electronic Health Records (EHR). We developed a pipeline that casts different EHR-layers, such as lab- and clinical- data, into a shared latent space and performs clustering accordingly. Next, we compare the baseline characteristics and treatment response between the clusters.

We identified four different RA subsets: 1) arthritis in feet, 2) seropositive oligo-articular disease, 3) seronegative hand arthritis, 4) polyarthritis. We conducted sensitivity analysis, external validation and 1000 times bootstrapping to ensure that our clusters were valid, generalizable and stable.

## Workflow

Workflow depicting the different steps of our pipeline. We start off with 25,000+ dossiers of patients that visited the outpatient clinic, then we apply a patient selection whereby we request at a minimum follow-up of 1 year and a first visit after the initialization of our digital system in 2011. Next, we feed the conclusion section - containing the physicianâ€™s verdict - to a Machine Learning Method to identify the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients based on their diagnosis. We end up with the records of 1,387 RA-patients which are supplied to the EHR clustering pipeline, where we preprocess the different EHR-components and combine this information to construct a patient embedding with MMAE. We employ graph clustering (w/ PhenoGraph) on this feature space to stratify patients. The clusters were further analyzed with a SHAP analysis, to identify the signatures that drive the distinct clinical manifestions

To ensure the robustness of our findings, we tested a) cluster stability (1000 fold) b) physician confounding, c) association with remission and methotrexate failure and d) generalizability to a second different data set (Leiden Early Arthritis clinic; n=769).

### Replication in a second dataset
We replicated the clustering and the downstream analysis (SHAP & survival analysis) in an seperate independent dataset for external validation. To investigate the replicability of the clustering we projected our novel patients unto our learned patient embedding, and assigned them to a cluster based on their orientation with respect to the old data. This projection was achieved with ![alt text]POODLE(https://github.com/levrex/Poodle)
